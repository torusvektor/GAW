/**
 * Keeps the top toolbar inside the window.
 *
 * The toolbar needs about 1500px at full size and more once audio is on (the
 * BPM widget) or a recording is running, while the window can be as narrow as
 * 1200px. On a 1280px laptop screen the right-hand end, Stage, Settings and
 * Connect Mobile, was simply off the edge of the window with no way to reach
 * it.
 *
 * Rather than guess breakpoints, this measures. When the last group runs past
 * the toolbar's edge it steps up a compact level (`tb-compact-1` .. `-N`, each
 * applied on top of the previous), and steps back down as soon as the full
 * layout fits again. The styles for each level live with the toolbar. The top
 * level lets the centre group scroll sideways, so nothing can end up
 * unreachable however much the toolbar holds.
 *
 * Everything runs in a requestAnimationFrame, so a level change is laid out
 * before the frame is painted, and never inside a ResizeObserver callback,
 * which would report a loop error when the level changes a group's size.
