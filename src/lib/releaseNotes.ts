    summary: [
      'The transform gizmo on point cloud and 3D model layers is now keyframeable.',
      'Keyframes apply while scrubbing, and rendered video finally honors them.',

    ],
    highlights: [
      'Point cloud and 3D model layers can keyframe the on-canvas gizmo, so position, rotation and scale animate into camera-style moves.',
      'Scrubbing the keyframe timeline shows the interpolated pose instead of the last value set, so in-between keyframes can be judged by eye.',
      'Rendered video honors keyframes — export seeks the timeline, and that path previously skipped every keyframe and exported a static frame.',
      'Undo and redo record layer property edits across the app; previously only structural actions were tracked, so one undo could discard a whole layer of work.',
      'Undo and redo also cover keyframe edits — add, delete, move, retime, value and easing — restored together with the project.',
      'Point cloud layers gain a Material and Glow section: shininess, metallic, fresnel, emissive, specular and rim tints, and a per-point glow.',
      'Point cloud specular highlights now track the camera instead of a fixed view direction, so they move as the cloud is orbited.',
      'Datamosh gains a flicker-speed control, and Constellation gains speed, a blend mode, and a travelling wave mode.',
      'Point cloud mouse interaction is stronger by default with a much wider usable range.',
      'New Quotron generator: a 1970s quote terminal with eleven programs, six phosphors and seven glyph ROMs, rolled from a seed with a Generate button, adapting its character grid to the composition resolution.',

      'OSC and MIDI controls can trigger VJ clips, Mapping presets, and Mapping or VJ video transport controls through normalized parameter paths.',
      'Trimmed videos stay inside their selected range, loop back to trim-in, and keep the timeline playhead aligned with the active trim.',

      'Stage Designer geometry edits support Cmd/Ctrl+Z, redo, grouped drag history, and canceling an active drag with Escape.',
      'Multi-selected mapping slices can be stretched from any side as a group while retaining the existing uniform scale control.',
      'Layer blend modes are restored to full-strength compositing, with opacity acting as the straightforward layer mix amount.',

    ],
    highlights: [
      'Stage effects now resolve against each recalled stage preset instead of remaining attached only to the newest preset.',
      'WLED output stays active while switching presets and now includes Auto, Strip, Matrix, and Custom spatial maps; source-region cropping; serpentine and reverse wiring; linear-light per-controller color matching; live shader palette sampling; and LED-order, chase, and solid-color test patterns.',

      'The Sphere venue now uses a true dome-style screen with better default framing, editable dome tuning controls, screen/room inspector tabs, locked venue defaults, and a more recognizable room layout.',
      'Stage 3D lighting fixtures now have richer per-fixture controls, patterns, colors, timing modes, and lower-cost beams so movers, washes, blinders, strips, lasers, and haze read more like a live rig.',
      'Mapping and Stage Designer workflows gained marquee multi-select, multi-layer transform improvements, arrow-key movement, clearer layer drop indicators, restored grid/snap access, and fixed warp editing after marquee selection.',

      'Map Sim top controls are reorganized for real work: New, Save, Load, Copy, Paste, Delete, transform tools, view controls, sync, fullscreen, and record are grouped with clearer iconography.',
      'New effect-library visuals include phase/magnification-inspired tools and the recent experimental visuals as reusable effects, so they can be applied to any source instead of living as isolated shader layers.',
      'SRC webcam feeds now mirror by default for natural performer-facing camera control.',
      'The UI typography pass moves Ghost Arcade onto a consistent Geist + Geist Mono system, trims front-facing UI type by 1px, and normalizes mixed font weights/casing across panels.',

      'Map Sim and Stage Sim now keep unsaved edits scoped to the active scene, ask whether to keep added elements when switching presets, and stop carrying unsaved objects into the next app launch.',
      'Map Sim object editing is tighter: lockable projectors and objects, scene click selection, copy/paste, delete, snapping, even-spacing guides, GLB import parity with mapping-mode 3D model layers, and the focused isometric cube, fragmented cube, and museum presets.',
      'Projection rendering has stronger real-world behavior with one-sided projection, darker backsides, floor hits when the projector is angled correctly, projector shadow controls, and smoother intensity changes.',
      'VJ Layer Sequencer fixes live cell updates so clicks show immediately, adds slower crossfade timing, and expands movement intervals beyond 1/4 steps.',
      'VJ layers and group layers can now choose the full VJ Mix as an output source when that is the cleanest routing path.',
      'GPU Shader photo/video point-cloud effects now derive depth from the source image, preserve source colors, and add smoother particle motion controls for animated depth-cloud looks.',
      'Render to Video adds a JPEG frame-sequence output path and fixes GPU Shader offline timing so exported frames advance one virtual frame at a time, including slow-motion workflows compiled at a lower FPS.',
