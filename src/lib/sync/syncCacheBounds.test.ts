/**
 * Every cache in the sync layer must have a way out.
 *
 * NativeRendererSync keeps ~35 Maps and Sets keyed by things that churn during
 * a set: layer ids, source keys, live-capture session ids that are regenerated
 * on every camera restart. A cache that is only ever written to is a slow leak
 * that nothing catches — it does not fail, it just grows for the length of the
 * show. Four were in that state when this test was written:
 *
 *   nativeTextState              rasterized glyph atlases, per layer id
 *   nativeModel3DState           mesh state, per layer id
 *   sharedTextureInfoCache       per live-capture session id
 *   sharedTextureInfoNextPollAt  same, plus its `:failures` counters
 *
 * This is a source-level check rather than a runtime one because the leak has
 * no observable symptom until it is large. Anything that writes to a
 * collection must also delete, clear, or reassign it somewhere.
