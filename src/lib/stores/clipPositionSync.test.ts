/**
 * External timeline sync: a DAW, a show controller, or Beat Link Trigger
 * following a CDJ sends "the track is at N seconds" and the clip follows.
 *
 * The OSC path vj:<layer>:video:position already existed and already parsed
 * correctly. What it did was write videoElement.currentTime — and under the
 * native engine that element is not what renders, so nothing moved on screen.
 * The report reads as "Ghost Arcade fails to receive the track's timeline
 * position", but the message arrived fine and was applied to the wrong clock.
 *
 * Source-level, because the router reaches the native transport through the
 * whole store and the renderer sync; what is worth pinning is which clock the
 * position lands on and that a continuous stream does not re-seek per message.
