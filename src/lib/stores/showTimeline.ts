/**
 * Show Timeline — the mapping-mode arrangement surface.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS
 * ----------
 * Audio files on lanes, mapping presets (Compositions) laid out along a
 * single preset lane, one deterministic transport driving both. "Preset 1
 * for a minute, preset 2 for thirty seconds" — a fully programmed A/V show
 * that saves with the project and can be recorded or rendered out.
 *
 * THREE RULES HOLD THIS TOGETHER
 * ------------------------------
 * 1. `seek(seconds)` IS THE SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH. The RAF transport, the
 *    scrub handle, and the offline renderer all funnel through it. It
 *    decides which preset clip is live at that instant, fires the
 *    composition swap when (and only when) that answer changes, and moves
 *    the store's clock. Nothing else may fire a preset.
 *
 * 2. THE COMPOSITION LOADER IS INJECTED. `layers.ts` registers it at module
 *    init (`setShowCompositionLoader`). This store never imports `layers.ts`
 *    — that would be a cycle, and it would drag the whole project store into
 *    every unit test of the arrangement maths.
 *
 * 3. NOTHING HAPPENS WHEN THE TIMELINE IS EMPTY. No RAF, no AudioContext,
 *    no `loadComposition`, no elements. `play()` refuses on a zero-length
 *    show; audio elements are constructed on the first `addAudioTrack`.
 *
 * OVERLAP + SNAPPING (see `placeOnLane` / `snapShowTime`)
 * -------------------------------------------------------
 * • The preset lane is strictly single-occupancy: a show plays ONE
 *   composition at a time, so overlap is meaningless. Moves clamp into the
 *   free window under the pointer, and a move into a window narrower than
 *   the clip is refused rather than silently resized.
 * • Gaps on the preset lane are legal. Inside a gap no clip is active and
 *   the last-fired composition stays on screen — blanking the output for a
 *   hole in the arrangement would be worse than holding the picture.
 * • Audio tracks are one-per-lane-row and may freely overlap ACROSS lanes
 *   (that layering is the whole point); within a lane they follow the same
 *   single-occupancy rule as presets.
 * • Snapping is to a 0.25 s grid plus magnetic pull to any other clip edge
 *   and to 0, whichever is nearer, inside a zoom-aware tolerance.
 *
 * TRANSITIONS (see the "Clip transitions" section below)
 * ------------------------------------------------------
 * A transition is an object that lives at the JUNCTION between two adjacent
 * preset clips, stored on the right-hand clip as `transitionIn` +
 * `transitionDuration` and seeded from the preset tray's own settings so the
 * two players match. It is CENTRED on the boundary — half of it reaches back
 * into the outgoing clip and half forward into the incoming one, the way
 * Premiere and CapCut place one — and is clamped so it can never be longer
 * than the material either neighbour has to give it.
 *
 * PRESETTRAY CONFLICT
 * -------------------
 * The show timeline OWNS scheduled preset changes. While it is playing,
 * PresetTray's auto-advance is stopped and cannot be restarted (its button
 * disables). Manual preset clicks still work as an operator punch-in; the
 * show takes back over at its next clip boundary.

// ─── Clip transitions ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// SEMANTICS: CENTRED ON THE JUNCTION.
// -----------------------------------
// A transition is an OBJECT sitting at the junction between two adjacent
// clips, stored on the right-hand clip as `transitionIn` +
// `transitionDuration`. A `D`-second transition at boundary `t0` runs over
// `[t0 - D/2, t0 + D/2)` — half reaching back into the outgoing clip, half
// forward into the incoming one. That is where Premiere and CapCut put one
// by default, and it is what makes the timeline element the user drags a
// truthful picture of when the blend is on screen.
//
// This REPLACES the original start-at semantics, where the blend ran forward
// over `[startTime, startTime + D)`. That was forced by the old mechanism:
// `engine.startTransition()` froze the outgoing composite and cross-faded
// the snapshot out, so nothing could happen before the swap. The native
// implementation has no snapshot — it puts BOTH compositions' layers in the
// scene at once (renderer/compositionTransitionLayers.ts) — so the blend can
// start before the boundary without the incoming composition being "live"
// yet.
//
// THE ONE RULE STILL HOLDS. `findActiveShowClip` still decides which clip is
// live, and `loadComposition` still fires only when that answer changes, at
// `t0` exactly. During `[t0 - D/2, t0)` the OUTGOING composition is the
// loaded one and the incoming is a transient clone; after `t0` the roles
// reverse. Both halves publish the same `{from, to, progress}`, so the layer
// builder sees one continuous blend across the swap.
//
// ADJACENCY. A transition needs two clips actually touching. Across a gap
// there is nothing to transition FROM at the moment the blend would start —
// the outgoing picture is being held, not played — so a gap is a hard cut.
//
// DETERMINISM. `progress` is a pure function of (clips, show time). A cold
// `seek()` into the middle of a transition resolves to exactly the same
// state as playing into it, with no animation left to run, which is what
// lets the offline renderer honour transitions at all: it calls `seek()`
// once per virtual frame and gets a reproducible blend every time.
//
// STACKING. The effective duration is clamped to the shorter neighbour,
// which (because the window is centred, so each side only spends D/2) means
// two adjacent transitions can touch but never overlap.
