    "DESCRIPTION": "The Hopf fibration, rendered volumetrically. Every point of the 3-sphere lies on exactly one circle, and every two of those circles are linked -- no pair can be pulled apart. Projected into 3D the result is space entirely filled with interlocking rings. Each sample is inverse-projected back onto S3 and pushed through the Hopf map to find which fibre it belongs to, so the linkage emerges from the mathematics rather than from drawn geometry. A 4D rotation of the sphere before the map rolls the whole fibration through itself. Bass swells the fibres, beats turn the 4D rotation, spectral centroid walks the base sphere.",

/*
 * The Hopf fibration.
 *
 * The Hopf map sends the 3-sphere to the 2-sphere, and the preimage of every
 * point of S2 is a great circle of S3. So S3 is partitioned entirely into
 * circles -- and any two of them are linked exactly once, like consecutive
 * links of a chain that cannot be separated without cutting. Stereographic
 * projection carries those circles into R3, where they remain circles (a
 * straight line for the one through the projection point), and the result is
 * three-dimensional space completely filled with interlocking rings.
 *
 * How this is drawn, which is the whole point.
 *
 * The obvious approach is to build fibre geometry: pick base points, work out
 * each projected circle's centre, radius and normal, then take a distance to
 * every one. That is dozens of operations per fibre per sample, and a
 * volumetric march needs thousands of samples per pixel.
 *
 * Run the map the other way instead. For a sample p in R3, inverse-project it
 * onto S3 and push it through the Hopf map. That yields the point of S2 whose
 * fibre passes through p -- roughly twenty operations, independent of how many
 * fibres are lit. Asking "which fibre am I on" is enormously cheaper than
 * asking "how far is the nearest fibre", and the linkage is not drawn or faked:
 * it falls out of the map, which is why the rings interlock correctly from
 * every angle without any geometry knowing about any other.
 *
 * Lighting a discrete set of fibres is then just a pattern on the base sphere.
 * A lattice in (longitude, colatitude) picks out a family of base points, each
 * of which blooms into one ring in R3.
 *
 * The 4D rotation applies to S3 before the map. That is not a rotation of the
 * projected object: it slides the fibration through itself, so rings migrate
 * across the family, swell and shrink, and turn inside out through the
 * projection point -- motion with no 3D equivalent.
