    "DESCRIPTION": "Aperiodic quasicrystal built from superposed plane waves. Five wave directions at equal angular spacing give ten-fold rotational symmetry, which no periodic crystal can have, so the pattern never repeats however far it runs. The sum of cosines has an exact analytic gradient, so the relief is lit and the contours are antialiased from real derivatives rather than finite differences. Bass drives relief depth, beats jump the phase, spectral centroid counter-rotates the second lattice.",

/*
 * Quasicrystals by plane-wave superposition.
 *
 * Sum N cosine plane waves whose directions are spaced evenly over 180 degrees:
 *
 *     h(p) = sum_i cos( k_i . p + phase ),   k_i = (cos(pi i/N), sin(pi i/N))
 *
 * For N = 5 the result has ten-fold rotational symmetry. The crystallographic
 * restriction theorem says a periodic lattice can only have 2, 3, 4 or 6-fold
 * symmetry, so ten-fold forces the pattern to be APERIODIC: it is ordered and
 * self-similar everywhere yet never repeats, however far it is extended. That
 * is the whole point of the piece, and it is why N = 5 and N = 7 look
 * fundamentally different from N = 3 and N = 6, which are ordinary lattices.
 *
 * Two payoffs from the field being a sum of cosines rather than noise:
 *
 *   1. Exact gradient. d/dp sum cos(k.p + ph) = -sum k sin(k.p + ph), which
 *      costs the sin that the cos already needed. So the relief is lit from a
 *      true analytic normal, not a finite difference -- no extra field
 *      evaluations, and no stair-stepping where the slope is steep.
 *
 *   2. Exact antialiasing. Knowing |grad h| gives the on-screen rate of change
 *      of the field, so contour width can be specified in pixels directly.
 *      That is what fwidth() estimates by differencing neighbours; here the
 *      real number is already in hand, which matters because these contours
 *      get arbitrarily dense toward high scale and a guessed width aliases
 *      into moire long before the true one does.
 *
 * A second lattice at an incommensurate scale and counter-rotation is layered
 * over the first. Two quasiperiodic fields at an irrational ratio never come
 * back into phase, so the interference between them also never repeats.
