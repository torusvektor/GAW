# HandFX performance guide

HandFX turns tracked hands into a transparent visual instrument. Add the HandFX plugin to a Mapping layer or a VJ clip, then open its plugin controls.

## Start here

Choose **Input → Rehearsal · no camera** to audition looks with two animated virtual hands. For a performance, choose **Live hands**, allow camera access, and bring your hands into view. Energy Bridge needs two hands; Orbital Field and Laser Fan work with one or two.

Live hands starts tracking automatically. **Show Camera** displays the selfie feed beneath the graphics and defaults on for new HandFX clips. **Camera Opacity** dims the feed without dimming the graphics. Hiding the feed or setting opacity to zero keeps tracking active. Rehearsal does not require or start a camera.

## Looks and gestures

| Look | How to play it |
| --- | --- |
| Energy Bridge | Move two palms apart to stretch interwoven light strands; bring them together to compress the bridge. |
| Orbital Field | Each palm carries animated rings. Pinch thumb and index to contract them; release to expand. |
| Laser Fan | Spread and rotate your fingers to fan and aim the beams. Thumb–index distance also controls their reach. |
| Paint | Move fingertips to emit flowing particles and sparks. |
| Ink | Paint soft drifting clouds with your fingertips. |
| Pinch Spray | Pinch thumb and index to emit particles; release to let them drift and fade. |
| Neon Skeleton | Trace the tracked hand joints with illuminated lines. |
| Panel | Position two hands to define a rectangle. Try Difference blending over other content. |

## Shape the performance

- **Palette:** Deep Ocean, Ember Gold, Ultraviolet, Acid Green, Pure Light, Coral, Ice, or Spectrum. Original mode colors preserves the older per-look color settings.
- **Brightness:** overall light intensity.
- **Audio response:** adds energy from the app's connected audio input. Zero disables it; visuals still respond to hands without audio.
- **Field size:** adjusts the scale of the three field looks. **Strands / rings** controls complexity in Bridge and Orbit. **Stroke width** controls line thickness.
- **Smoothing / Predict Ahead:** tune tracking feel. Higher smoothing softens motion; prediction helps compensate for tracking latency but can overshoot abrupt changes.
- **Background Opacity:** keep at zero for an overlay, or raise it for a darker backdrop. Add or Screen layer blending works well over video.

The controls participate in the plugin panel's MIDI Learn system. Saved projects retain their settings; existing projects without a new palette selection retain their original colors.

Hand tracking uses MediaPipe. Visuals and particle simulation run in the native GPU renderer; the camera image is composited beneath the effects through native shared textures. Use even lighting and keep your hands clear of each other for reliable tracking. Rehearsal verifies the visuals but does not verify your camera or real tracking latency.

## New performance looks

- **Star Portal**: each palm carries a tunnel of luminous gates. Pinch thumb and index to narrow the tunnel; open to expand it. Field size changes its reach; Strands / rings changes its symmetry.
- **Electric Web**: filaments connect all five fingertips. Spread, curl, and rotate your fingers to stretch the network. Field size controls the flutter; Stroke width controls the filaments.
- **Silk Flow**: ribbons stream from your palm in the direction of your fingers. Open your hand to fan them out; pinch to gather them. Strands / rings adjusts density.

Previous, Shuffle, and Next step through all eleven modes. Shuffle always chooses a different mode and preserves your palette, camera input, and tuning. Rehearsal works with all three new looks. These looks run in the desktop native GPU renderer; camera tracking still requires a supported camera and MediaPipe input.

Audio response now follows a gradual bass/energy envelope rather than raw beat peaks. Your gestures remain immediate while music changes the light and field continuously. The MediaPipe selfie preview mirrors the camera image to match tracking; toggling Mirror updates both.
